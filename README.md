# STORM-LC-implementation

[STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) is a research assistant designed by Shao, et. al that extends the idea of "outline-driven RAG" for richer article generation.

This repository is an implementation of the article's DSPy framework to:

- LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Optimising for use of [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) searching API
- Implementing [Prompt-Optimizer](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/prompt-optimizer-tweet-drafts?organizationId=1fa8b1f4-fcb9-4072-9aa9-983e35ad61b8)
- Monitor and Optimise via LangSmith
- Deploy as an app via Streamlit
